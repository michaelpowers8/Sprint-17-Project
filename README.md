You'll be given several tasks, and members of the Student Guidance Team will be helping you complete them. They're going to be your colleagues for the next 14 days. </div><h2>Colleagues</h2><ul><li>The <strong>team leader</strong> will be giving you tasks and making sure you complete them successfully</li><li>The <strong>project reviewer</strong> will review your code. They are independent experts from another department who work in machine learning, but they don't know the details of the task</li></ul><h2>Tasks</h2><div class="paragraph">To complete the final sprint successfully, you'll need a score of five <strong>story points</strong> (SP). These are conventional units for measuring the task's difficulty. You'll get:</div><ul><li>4 to 6 SP for the main project</li><li>1 SP for the additional assignment</li></ul><div class="paragraph">You're going to build a prototype of a machine learning model following these instructions:</div><ol start="1"><li><strong>Make a work plan</strong>. When you first see the task, you'll notice that it's incomplete and contains unnecessary information. Perform exploratory data analysis to figure out which questions you need to ask.</li><li><strong>Investigate the task</strong>. Ask your team leader any questions you may have.</li><li><strong>Develop a model</strong>. Submit your code to the project reviewer.</li><li><strong>Prepare a report</strong>. Send the report to your team leader so that they can make sure you've completed the tasks correctly.</li></ol><div class="paragraph">The final score depends on the quality of your model.</div><div class="paragraph">The additional assignment is based on the same data as the main project. </div><div class="paragraph">At the end of the sprint, your code will be reviewed by the team leader.</div><div class="paragraph">In the video below, our tutor, Anthony, will guide you through the steps and expectations for your work.</div><div class="paragraph paragraph_has-one-child"><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdMX_Pzd1Is"></iframe></div></div></div></section></section></section><div class="next-lesson-control next-lesson-control_state_ready prism prism_theme_light"><button class="prism-button prism-button_icon-placement_left prism-button_position-in-group_none prism-button_size_l prism-button_view_primary prism-button_accent_default next-lesson-control__button"><span class="prism-button__content"><span class="prism-button__text"><span class="prism-button__label">Next Chapter</span></span></span></button></div></main>
